# Program Finder Vertical Product

Many higher education institutions structure their study options using the following:

* Programs - Primary type - This is the overarching qualification which is through completing one or more secondary.
* Courses - Secondary type - These are the units of study which needs to be completed and contribute credit points towards earning qualifications (i.e. primary type).  

Note: The study options can be much more diverse but we will ignore them for the time being as the current Program Finder only focuses these two.

Sadly, the names used for the primary and secondary types will vary between region to region.

e.g.
* In the US, the primary type is "Programs" and the secondary is "Courses"
* In the UK, it is Courses and Subjects.
* In AU, it is Courses and Units.

The following is a guide on how to configure the Program Finder to better suit the language of the institution.

At a higher level, it will involve:

* Configuring the localisation finder type
* Change the name of the facet
* Configure the search previews
* Configure the concierge channel - `stencils.auto-completion.datasets.courses.name=Programs`
* Change the service title - `service.title=Program Finder`
