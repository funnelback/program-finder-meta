>>>

## Domain name and SSL

The search will be available on a Funnelback URL by default (e.g. search-`CLIENTNAME`.clients.funnelback.com).

>>>
__TODO__: Please change the above if a custom domain name is required (e.g. search.example.com) and provide information how it has been implemented.

i.e. Has the client added a CNAME entry in the DNS to point to the search URL?

Note: If SSL is required on a custom domain, a SSL certificate must be purchased by the client and provided to Funnelback.

>>>
__TODO__: Please populate the above table with the users and roles founds on the system.

Please note that we only require a high level summary of the functional aspect of the user. Information around the technical details such as Funnelback permissions and collections and profiles they have access to will be captured during the migration when the user.ini are carried across.

## Collection configurations

Please refer to each collection for information on `why` and  `what` features are implemented.

>>>
__TODO__: Please complete a collection overview document (`@documentation/collection-over.md`) for each collection. An example can be found in [collection overview](implementation-collection-overview.md).
